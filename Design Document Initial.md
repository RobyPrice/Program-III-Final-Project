# Introduction 
My purpose for this project is to track clothing that I find on the day to day and might want to purchase later as well keep track of clothes I already have.

# Data Structures 
I was thinking about what data structures I wanted to use and I think I came to the conclusion of using [[Array]]s and [[Linked Lists]].  My hope is that this will give me easy access to the data that I need and keep the information in an easy to understand manner. The array will contain each individual item and it's other classes. For instance (Jcrew, Cardigan, $200, Alpaca). My thought process is to then connect the items with linked lists.

# Search Algorithms
This collection will use [[Binary Search]] and [[Exponential Search]] due to the potential complexity of this collection and because of the way they work with each other.

# Sorting Algorithms
[[Quadratic sorting]], specifically [[Insertion sort]] is the sorting method that will be used in this collection. Intended to offer better ease of use and clarity while creating the collection. In addition to still run on O(n) time for more complex arrays. 

# User interface Design
Users will interact with the program by getting a series of prompts. Each prompt will be associated with a class that is need to complete the array. Users will insert each piece of data as prompted by the program. In terms of searching for items already in the collection, I would like there to be a menu on startup of the program. The menu will ask the user chose between searching the collection or adding to the collection.

# Persistent Storage
I plan on using a .java file as my persistent storage. I am using this file type because I plan and coding this program in Java.
# Exception Handling 
In terms of handling errors, I will try to trouble shoot myself by using the vast documentation on the internet. Aside from that I will lean on classmates and friends if I cannot troubleshoot my way out of a problem.
